# inbox-colour

The simplest chrome plugin, it changes the header on inbox.google.com to green.

I did this because I use two windows of chrome, each with their own user, and I wanted to be able to differentiate between them visually, so one chrome user has this plugin installed.

## Installation

If you want to load this plugin, you can clone this repo and then follow the instructions here: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked

You will have to change the directory etc to point to wherever you cloned this repo.

## Customization

And heck, if you're changing that, you could go crazy and change the colour to something other than green! Go crazy!

Just change the one thing in the css file to be a different colour. O.o
